<p><h2>What to Work On?</h2></p>
<p><h3>1.</h3>Instead of having an event listener only on keyDown, you should have a keyUp listener too and store the currenty pushed down button if it's left or right.</p>

<p>So when you push down the left/right button, the movement action should go till the keyUp listener deletes that stored button</p>

<p>This will prevent the movement delay after pressing down the button.</p>
